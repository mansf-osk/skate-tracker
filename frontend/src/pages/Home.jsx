      <p>
        Here you can track tricks you want to learn, can already do or just want
        to remember.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can track tricks by name, category, difficulty and having learned them or not.
        You can also link to your clips on youtube and reminisce about your past session right here on this site!</p>

      <p>
        The tracked tricks can be filtered by name or if they've been learned.
      </p>

      <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
